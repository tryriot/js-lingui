# Vue Apps Internationalization

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to add internationalization (i18n) to an existing Vue 3 application. We'll focus on the most common patterns and best practices for using Lingui in Vue single-file components.

:::tip Example
If you're looking for a working solution, check out the [Examples](/examples) page. It contains sample projects with the complete setup using Lingui and Vue.

It includes an example for _Vue with Vite_.
:::

## Installing Lingui

1. Follow the [Installation and Setup](/installation) page for initial setup.
2. Install the [`@lingui/core`](/ref/core), [`@lingui/vue`](/ref/vue) and [`@lingui/extractor-vue`](/ref/extractor-vue) packages:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @lingui/core @lingui/vue
npm install --save-dev @lingui/cli @lingui/vite-plugin @lingui/extractor-vue
```

## Example Component

We're going to translate the following one-page mailbox application:

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import { createApp } from "vue";
import Inbox from "./Inbox.vue";

createApp(Inbox).mount("#app");
```

```vue title="src/Inbox.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
const messages = [{}, {}];
const messagesCount = messages.length;
const lastLogin = new Date();
const markAsRead = () => {
  alert("Marked as read.");
};
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Message Inbox</h1>

    <p>
      See all <a href="/unread">unread messages</a> or <a @click="markAsRead">mark them</a> as read.
    </p>

    <p>
      {{
        messagesCount === 1
          ? `There's ${messagesCount} message in your inbox.`
          : `There are ${messagesCount} messages in your inbox.`
      }}
    </p>

    <footer>Last login on {{ lastLogin.toLocaleDateString() }}.</footer>
  </div>
</template>
```

This application is a simple mailbox with a header, a paragraph with a link and a button, another paragraph with a message count, and a footer with the last login date. We will use it as the basis for our tutorial.

## Configure Lingui for Vue

We recommend using `defineConfig` from `@lingui/vue/config` to create the configuration. It provides all required options for you. Add the [Vue extractor](/ref/extractor-vue) so messages are extracted from `.vue` files:

```ts title="lingui.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@lingui/vue/config";
import { createVueExtractor } from "@lingui/extractor-vue";
import babel from "@lingui/cli/api/extractors/babel";

export default defineConfig({
  locales: ["en", "cs"],
  sourceLocale: "en",
  catalogs: [
    {
      path: "src/locales/{locale}/messages",
      include: ["src"],
    },
  ],
  extractors: [babel, createVueExtractor()],
});
```

This is equivalent to:

```ts title="lingui.config.ts"
export default {
  locales: ["en", "cs"],
  sourceLocale: "en",
  catalogs: [
    {
      path: "src/locales/{locale}/messages",
      include: ["src"],
    },
  ],
  extractors: [babel, createVueExtractor()],
  macro: {
    jsxPackage: ["@lingui/vue/macro"],
    jsxRuntime: "vue",
  },
  runtimeConfigModule: {
    Trans: ["@lingui/vue", "Trans"],
    useLingui: ["@lingui/vue", "useLingui"],
  },
};
```

## Configure Vite

Setup Lingui in `vite.config.ts`. The [`linguiVue`](/ref/vue#vite-integration) plugin teaches the Vue template compiler about Lingui macros and runs the Babel macro on `<script setup>` blocks and regular modules, and [`lingui`](/ref/vite-plugin) loads the message catalogs:

```ts title="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";
import { lingui } from "@lingui/vite-plugin";
import { linguiVue } from "@lingui/vue/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue(), linguiVue(), lingui()],
});
```

## Setup

We will start translating the `Inbox` component right away, but we need to do one more step to set up our application.

Components need to read information about current language and message catalogs from the [`i18n`](/ref/core#i18n) instance. Lingui uses the [`I18nProvider`](/ref/vue#i18nprovider) to pass the `i18n` instance to your Vue components.

Let's add all required imports and wrap our app inside [`I18nProvider`](/ref/vue#i18nprovider):

```vue title="src/App.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { i18n } from "@lingui/core";
import { I18nProvider } from "@lingui/vue";
import { messages } from "./locales/en/messages";
import Inbox from "./Inbox.vue";

i18n.load("en", messages);
i18n.activate("en");
</script>

<template>
  <I18nProvider :i18n="i18n">
    <Inbox />
  </I18nProvider>
</template>
```

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";

createApp(App).mount("#app");
```

:::tip
If you prefer a Vue plugin over a wrapper component, [`createLingui`](/ref/vue#createlingui) provides the same context to the whole application with `app.use(createLingui({ i18n }))`.
:::

:::info
You might be wondering: how are we going to change the active language? That's what the [`I18n.load`](/ref/core#i18n.load) and [`i18n.activate`](/ref/core#i18n.activate) calls are for! However, we cannot change the language unless we have the translated message catalog. And to get the catalog, we first need to extract all messages from the source code.
:::

## Introducing Internationalization

Now we're finally going to _translate_ our application. Actually, we're not going to _translate_ from one language to another right now. Instead, we're going to _prepare_ our app for translation. This process is called _internationalization_.

Let's start with the basics - static messages. These messages don't have any variables, HTML or components inside. Just some text:

```html
<h1>Message Inbox</h1>
```

To make this heading translatable, simply wrap it in the [`Trans`](/ref/macro#trans) macro:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Trans } from "@lingui/vue/macro";
</script>

<template>
  <h1>
    <Trans>Message Inbox</Trans>
  </h1>
</template>
```

Using the `Trans` macro in templates is the easiest way to translate your Vue components. It handles translations of messages, including variables and other elements.

### Macros vs. Components

If you're wondering what [Macros](/ref/macro) are and the difference between macros and runtime components, here's a quick explanation.

In general, macros are executed at compile time and serve to transform the source code to make the message writing process easier. Vue templates are compiled by the Vue compiler, so `@lingui/vue` ships a [template transform](/ref/vue#template-transform) that plays the role of the macro there: it turns the message written inside `<Trans>` into the props of the runtime [`Trans`](/ref/vue#trans) component, and the Babel macro points the `@lingui/vue/macro` import of `<script setup>` to the runtime component from `@lingui/vue`.

Below is a brief example demonstrating this transformation:

```vue
<Trans>Hello {{ name }}</Trans>

<!-- ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ -->

<Trans v-bind="{ id: 'OVaF9k', message: 'Hello {name}', values: { name } }" />
```

As you can see, the [`Trans`](/ref/vue#trans) runtime component gets `id` and `message` props with a message in [ICU MessageFormat](/guides/message-format) syntax. We could write it manually, but it's just easier and shorter to write the template as we're used to and let the compiler generate the message for us.

The same transformation happens in `<script setup>` and in JSX files, where the [`@lingui/vue/macro`](/ref/macro) Babel macros are used instead.

:::tip Bundle Size Impact
Another advantage of using macros is that all non-essential properties are excluded from the production build. This results in a significant reduction in the size footprint for internationalization:

```vue
<!-- NODE_ENV=production -->
<Trans v-bind="{ id: 'OVaF9k', values: { name } }" />
```

:::

### Extracting Messages

Back to our project. It's nice to write templates and let the compiler generate messages under the hood. Let's check that it actually works correctly.

All messages from the source code must be extracted into external message catalogs. Message catalogs are interchange files between developers and translators. We're going to have one file per language.

:::info
Refer to the [Message Extraction](/guides/message-extraction) guide for more information about various message extraction concepts and strategies.
:::

Let's switch to the command line for a moment. Execute the [`extract`](/ref/cli#extract) CLI command. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the extracted message statistics in the output:

```bash
> lingui extract

Catalog statistics:
┌──────────┬─────────────┬─────────┐
│ Language │ Total count │ Missing │
├──────────┼─────────────┼─────────┤
│ cs       │      1      │    1    │
│ en       │      1      │    1    │
└──────────┴─────────────┴─────────┘
```

As a result, we have two new files in the `locales` directory: `en/messages.po` and `cs/messages.po`. These files contain extracted messages from the source code.

Let's take a look at the Czech message catalog:

```gettext title="src/locales/cs/messages.po"
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"POT-Creation-Date: 2021-07-22 21:44+0900\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"
"X-Generator: @lingui/cli\n"
"Language: cs\n"

// highlight-start
#: src/Inbox.vue:14
msgid "Message Inbox"
msgstr ""
// highlight-end
```

It contains the message we wrapped in the [`Trans`](/ref/vue#trans) component. Let's add the Czech translation:

```po title="src/locales/cs/messages.po" {3}
#: src/Inbox.vue:14
msgid "Message Inbox"
msgstr "Příchozí zprávy"
```

If we run the [`extract`](/ref/cli#extract) command again, we'll see that all the Czech messages have been translated:

```bash
> lingui extract

Catalog statistics:
┌──────────┬─────────────┬─────────┐
│ Language │ Total count │ Missing │
├──────────┼─────────────┼─────────┤
│ cs       │      1      │    0    │
│ en       │      1      │    1    │
└──────────┴─────────────┴─────────┘
```

That's great! So how do we load it into your application? Lingui introduces the concept of compiled message catalogs. Before we load messages into our application, we need to compile them.

Use the [`compile`](/ref/cli#compile) command to do this:

```bash
> lingui compile

Compiling message catalogs…
Done!
```

If you look inside the `locales/<locale>` directory, you'll see that there is a new file for each locale: `messages.js`. This file contains the compiled message catalog.

:::tip
If you use TypeScript, you can add the `--typescript` flag to the `compile` command to produce compiled message catalogs with TypeScript types.
:::

Let's load this file into our app and set active language to `cs`:

```vue title="src/App.vue" {4-5,8-12}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { i18n } from "@lingui/core";
import { I18nProvider } from "@lingui/vue";
import { messages as enMessages } from "./locales/en/messages";
import { messages as csMessages } from "./locales/cs/messages";
import Inbox from "./Inbox.vue";

i18n.load({
  en: enMessages,
  cs: csMessages,
});
i18n.activate("cs");
</script>

<template>
  <I18nProvider :i18n="i18n">
    <Inbox />
  </I18nProvider>
</template>
```

When we run the app, we see the inbox header is translated into Czech.

:::tip
Alternatively, you can load catalogs dynamically using the [`@lingui/vite-plugin`](/ref/vite-plugin) without the need to import compiled messages manually.
:::

### Summary of Basic Workflow

Let's go through the workflow again:

1. Add an [`I18nProvider`](/ref/vue#i18nprovider), this component provides the active language and catalog(s) to other components.
2. Wrap messages in the [`Trans`](/ref/vue#trans) component.
3. Run [`extract`](/ref/cli#extract) command to generate message catalogs.
4. Translate message catalogs (send them to translators usually).
5. Run [`compile`](/ref/cli#compile) to create runtime catalogs.
6. Load runtime catalog.
7. Profit! 🎉

It's not necessary to extract/translate messages one by one. This is usually done in batches. When you finish your work or PR, run [`extract`](/ref/cli#extract) to generate the latest message catalogs, and before building the application for production, run [`compile`](/ref/cli#compile).

## Formatting

Let's move on to another paragraph in our project. The following paragraph has some variables, some HTML and components inside:

```html
<p>
  See all <a href="/unread">unread messages</a> or <a @click="markAsRead">mark them</a> as read.
</p>
```

Although it looks complex, there's really nothing special here. Just wrap the content of the paragraph in [`Trans`](/ref/vue#trans) and let the compiler do the magic:

```html
<p>
  <Trans>
    See all <a href="/unread">unread messages</a> or <a @click="markAsRead">mark them</a> as read.
  </Trans>
</p>
```

Let's see how this message actually looks in the message catalog. Run the [`extract`](/ref/cli#extract) command and take a look at the message:

```gettext
#: src/Inbox.vue:20
msgid "See all <0>unread messages</0> or <1>mark them</1> as read."
msgstr ""
```

You may notice that components and html tags are replaced with indexed tags (`<0>`, `<1>`). This is a little extension to the ICU MessageFormat which allows rich-text formatting inside translations. Components and their props remain in the source code and don't scare our translators. Also, in case we change a `class`, we don't need to update our message catalogs.

Under the hood, the elements are moved to named slots of the `Trans` component, so all their attributes, bindings and event listeners keep working:

```vue
<Trans v-bind="{ id: '...', message: 'See all <0>unread messages</0> or <1>mark them</1> as read.' }">
  <template #0><a href="/unread" /></template>
  <template #1><a @click="markAsRead" /></template>
</Trans>
```

:::caution
Structural directives (`v-if`, `v-for`) can't be used on elements _inside_ a message, as the message must be static for translators. Put them on the `Trans` element itself, or move the condition outside of the message.
:::

### Template to MessageFormat Transformations

At first glance, these transformations might seem somewhat unconventional; however, they are straightforward, intuitive, and align well with Vue principles. There is no need to focus on MessageFormat, as the library handles its creation for us. We can write our templates as we typically would and simply wrap the text in the [`Trans`](/ref/vue#trans) component.

Let's see some examples with MessageFormat equivalents:

```html
<Trans>Hello {{ name }}</Trans>
<!-- Hello {name} -->
```

Any expressions are allowed, not just simple variables. The only difference is, only the variable name will be included in the extracted message:

- Any expression -> positional argument:

  ```html
  <Trans>Hello {{ user.name }}</Trans>
  <!-- Hello {0} -->
  ```

- Object, arrays, function calls -> positional argument:

  ```html
  <Trans>The random number is {{ Math.random() }}</Trans>
  <!-- The random number is {0} -->
  ```

- Use the `ph` macro to give a meaningful name to a placeholder:

  ```html
  <Trans>Hello {{ ph({ name: user.name }) }}</Trans>
  <!-- Hello {name} -->
  ```

- Elements might get tricky, but like we saw, it's really easy:

  ```html
  <Trans>Read <a href="/more">more</a>.</Trans>
  <!-- Read <0>more</0>. -->
  ```

  ```html
  <Trans>
    Dear Watson,
    <br />
    it's not exactly what I had in my mind.
  </Trans>
  <!-- Dear Watson,<0/>it's not exactly what I had in my mind. -->
  ```

:::caution
Try to keep your messages simple and avoid complex expressions. During extraction, these expressions will be replaced by placeholders, resulting in a lack of context for translators.

Similarly, to prevent numbered tag placeholders like `<0>` from depriving translators of context, use [named tag placeholders](/ref/conf#macrojsxplaceholderattribute) and enforce them with [`no-unnamed-tag-placeholders`](https://github.com/lingui/eslint-plugin/blob/main/docs/rules/no-unnamed-tag-placeholders.md).
:::

### Dates and Numbers

Take a look at the message in the footer of our component. It is a bit special because it contains a date:

```html
<footer>Last login on {{ lastLogin.toLocaleDateString() }}.</footer>
```

Dates (as well as numbers) are formatted differently in different languages, but we don't have to do this manually. The heavy lifting is done by the [`Intl` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl).

The `i18n` object can be accessed with the [`useLingui`](/ref/vue#uselingui) composable. It returns a reactive reference, so a `computed` that reads `i18n.value.locale` is re-evaluated when the language changes:

```vue title="src/Inbox.vue" {2,5,6,12}
<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed } from "vue";
import { Trans, useLingui } from "@lingui/vue/macro";

const { i18n } = useLingui();
const dateFormatter = computed(() => new Intl.DateTimeFormat(i18n.value.locale));
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <footer>
      <Trans>Last login on {{ dateFormatter.format(lastLogin) }}.</Trans>
    </footer>
  </div>
</template>
```

This will format the date using the conventional format for the active language. To format numbers, use `Intl.NumberFormat` in a similar way.

### Message ID

At this point, we'll explain what the message ID is and how to set it manually. Translators work with _message catalogs_. No matter what format we use, it's just a mapping of a message ID to the translation.

Here's an example of a simple message catalog in **Czech** language:

| Message ID | Translation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Monday     | Pondělí     |
| Tuesday    | Úterý       |
| Wednesday  | Středa      |

... and the same catalog in **French** language:

| Message ID | Translation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Monday     | Lundi       |
| Tuesday    | Mardi       |
| Wednesday  | Mercredi    |

The message ID is _what all catalogs have in common_ – "Lundi" and "Pondělí" represent the same message in different languages.

There are two approaches for creating a message ID:

- Automatically generated from message (e.g. `Monday`) and context, if available.
- Explicit message ID set by the developer (e.g. `days.monday`), using the `id` attribute: `<Trans id="days.monday">Monday</Trans>`.

:::info
Refer to the [Explicit vs Generated IDs](/guides/explicit-vs-generated-ids) guide for more information about the pros and cons of each approach.
:::

## Plurals

Let's take a closer look at the following code in our component:

```html
<p>
  {{
    messagesCount === 1
      ? `There's ${messagesCount} message in your inbox.`
      : `There are ${messagesCount} messages in your inbox.`
  }}
</p>
```

This message is a bit special, because it depends on the value of the `messagesCount` variable. Most languages use different forms of words when describing quantities - this is called [pluralization](/guides/plurals).

What's tricky is that different languages use different number of plural forms. For example, English has only two forms - singular and plural - as we can see in the example above. However, Czech language has three plural forms. Some languages have up to 6 plural forms and some don't have plurals at all!

:::info
Lingui uses `Intl.PluralRules` which is supported in [every modern browser](https://caniuse.com/intl-pluralrules) and can be polyfilled for older. So you don't need to setup anything special.
:::

### English Plural Rules

How do we know which plural form we should use? It's very simple: we, as developers, only need to know plural forms of the language we use in our source. Our component is written in English, so looking at [English plural rules](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#en) we'll need just two forms:

`one`

> Singular form

`other`

> Plural form

We don't need to select these forms manually. We'll use the `Plural` component, which takes a `value` prop and based on the active language, selects the right plural form:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Plural } from "@lingui/vue/macro";
</script>

<template>
  <p>
    <Plural :value="messagesCount" one="There's # message in your inbox" other="There are # messages in your inbox" />
  </p>
</template>
```

This component will render `There's 1 message in your inbox` when `messagesCount = 1` and `There are # messages in your inbox` for any other values of `messagesCount`. `#` is a placeholder, which is replaced with `value`.

Let's run the [`extract`](/ref/cli#extract) command to see the extracted message:

```icu-message-format
{messagesCount, plural,
  one {There's # message in your inbox}
  other {There are # messages in your inbox}
}
```

In the catalog, you'll see the message in a single line. Here we have wrapped it to make it more readable.

### Beware of Zeroes!

Just a short detour, because it's a common misunderstanding. You may wonder why the following code doesn't work as expected:

```html
<p>
  <Plural
    :value="messagesCount"
    zero="There are no messages"
    one="There's # message in your inbox"
    other="There are # messages in your inbox"
  />
</p>
```

This component will render `There are 0 messages in your inbox` for `messagesCount = 0`. Why so? Because English doesn't have `zero` plural form. Looking at [English plural rules](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html#en), it's:

| N   | Form                  |
| --- | --------------------- |
| 0   | other                 |
| 1   | one                   |
| n   | other (anything else) |

However, decimal numbers (even `1.0`) always use the `other` form:

```default
There are 0.0 messages in your inbox.
```

### Exact Forms

Going back to our example, what if we specifically want to display `There are no messages` when `messagesCount = 0`? This is where exact forms come in handy:

```html {4}
<p>
  <Plural
    :value="messagesCount"
    _0="There are no messages"
    one="There's # message in your inbox"
    other="There are # messages in your inbox"
  />
</p>
```

:::tip
MessageFormat allows exact forms, like `=0`. However, attributes can't start with `=`, so we need to write `_N` instead of `=0`.
:::

It works with any number, allowing for extensive customization as follows:

```html {4-6}
<p>
  <Plural
    :value="messagesCount"
    _0="There are no messages"
    _1="There's one message in your inbox"
    _2="There are two messages in your inbox, that's not much!"
    other="There are # messages in your inbox"
  />
</p>
```

Exact matches always take precedence over plural forms.

### Variables and Components

Let's go back to our original pluralized message:

```html
<p>
  <Plural :value="messagesCount" one="There's # message in your inbox" other="There are # messages in your inbox" />
</p>
```

To include variables or elements within a plural form, write the form as a named slot instead of an attribute:

```html
<p>
  <Plural :value="messagesCount">
    <template #one>There's # message in your inbox, {{ name }}</template>
    <template #other>There are <strong>#</strong> messages in your inbox, {{ name }}</template>
  </Plural>
</p>
```

Nested `Plural` and `Select` components, elements, variables, and expressions are all supported, providing the flexibility needed for any use case.

## Internationalization Outside of Templates

So far, we have learned how to translate strings within a template. However, what if we need to translate content that is outside the template or pass a translation as an attribute?

In our example, we have the following code:

```js
const markAsRead = () => {
  alert("Marked as read.");
};
```

To translate it, we will use the [`useLingui`](/ref/macro#uselingui) macro:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useLingui } from "@lingui/vue/macro";

const { t } = useLingui();

const markAsRead = () => {
  alert(t`Marked as read.`);
};
</script>
```

Now the `Marked as read.` message would be picked up by the extractor, and available for translation in the catalog.

You could also pass variables and use any other macro in the message:

```js
const { t } = useLingui();

const markAsRead = () => {
  const userName = "User1234";
  alert(t`Hello ${userName}, your messages marked as read!`);
};
```

:::tip
The `t` function also works inside templates, for example to translate element attributes such as `alt` in an `img` tag or `placeholder` in an `input`. The template compiler takes care of the rest:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useLingui } from "@lingui/vue/macro";

const { t } = useLingui();
</script>

<template>
  <img src="..." :alt="t`Image caption`" />
  <input :placeholder="t`Search`" />
</template>
```

:::

:::caution
All Core Macros cannot be used at the module level. They must be used within a component or function. See the [Macros](/ref/macro#using-macros) documentation for more information.
:::

## Review

After all modifications, the final i18n-ready component looks like this:

```vue title="src/Inbox.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed } from "vue";
import { Trans, Plural, useLingui } from "@lingui/vue/macro";

const { i18n, t } = useLingui();
const messages = [{}, {}];
const messagesCount = messages.length;
const lastLogin = new Date();
const markAsRead = () => {
  alert(t`Marked as read.`);
};

const dateFormatter = computed(() => new Intl.DateTimeFormat(i18n.value.locale));
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>
      <Trans>Message Inbox</Trans>
    </h1>

    <p>
      <Trans>
        See all <a href="/unread">unread messages</a> or <a @click="markAsRead">mark them</a> as read.
      </Trans>
    </p>

    <p>
      <Plural :value="messagesCount" one="There's # message in your inbox" other="There are # messages in your inbox" />
